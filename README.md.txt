CodeBook.md a code book which contains name and description of variables, and the manipulations performed on them.

run_analysis.R prepares the data and cleans the data according to the 5 steps described in the assignment:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Tidy Dataset Avg.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
