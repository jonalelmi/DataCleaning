The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and cleans the data according to the 5 steps in the assignment 

Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Assign each data to variables
feat <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
sub_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
sub_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 subjects
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
data_merged (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by row binding x_train and x_test (function rbind())

data_selection is a dataset obtained by selecting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each variable
 
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
data_sum (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing data_selection taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export data_sum into Tidy Dataset Avg.txt file.
